 \begin{abstract}
Juneau City in Alaska, USA is facing the problem of overtourism. The number of tourists and tax rates need to be adjusted to improve the satisfaction of tourists and residents, and finally realize sustainable development of tourism industry. The government has implemented some measures to limit the number of tourists, protect the environment, and improve local infrastructure, but the results have not been satisfactory due to the complex factors affecting tourist and resident satisfaction.
     
This article establishes a new satisfaction evaluation model that comprehensively considers the impact of tourist numbers on residents' income, government spending, ecological environment, and social pressure, in order to adjust the daily number of tourists and achieve multi-objective optimization of tourist and resident satisfaction.

\textit{The main steps are as follows:}
 
First, a causal model was established to analyze the principle of how the number of tourists affects tourist satisfaction and resident satisfaction.

 Then, based on the causal model and combined with the searched data, several equations were established to construct a multi-objective optimization model for the impact of tourist numbers on tourist satisfaction and resident satisfaction.

 To maximize stakeholder satisfaction, the NSGA-II genetic algorithm is used to solve the Pareto solution of the multi-objective problem and determine the optimal number of tourists.
 
 This study successfully simulated and optimized the number of tourists in Juneau city by constructing a causal diagram model, which benefits both tourists and residents, and more importantly, can achieve sustainable development of tourism in the Juneau area. In addition, through adjustments, the model can be applied to other destinations affected by excessive tourism and has good universality.

 \section{Introduction}
 \subsection{Background}
In recent years, the rapid development of the global tourism industry has brought many challenges, among which the problem of overtourism is particularly prominent. Take Juneau, Alaska, USA as an example. The city received about 1.6 million cruise passengers in 2023, setting a new record. On the busiest days of the tourism season, Juneau could receive up to seven large cruise ships, with as many as 20,000 visitors. Although these tourists brought in a substantial revenue of about 375 million dollars for the city, they also caused many problems, such as increased pressure on local infrastructure, tight drinking water supply, difficult waste management, and increased carbon footprint. In addition, overtourism has also had a negative impact on local culture and natural landscapes, of which the recession of Mendenhall Glacier is a typical case. Since 2007, the glacier has receded the equivalent of eight football fields, which not only caused local residents to worry about the disappearance of the glacier, but also raised questions about the sustainability of tourism. Therefore, how to maintain the economic benefits of tourism while reducing its negative impact on the environment and society, and achieve sustainable development, has become an urgent problem for Juneau to solve.
 
 \subsection{Restatement of the Problem}
 Given the context of overtourism in Juneau, Alaska, and its implications on both the environment and local community, the following issues need to be addressed:
 \begin{itemize}
    \item[$\bullet$]Develop a sustainable tourism model for Juneau, considering factors such as visitor numbers, overall revenue, and tourism stabilization measures. Clearly identify the factors to be optimized and those serving as constraints. Include a financial plan for additional revenue and demonstrate its feedback loop into the model for sustainable tourism promotion. Conduct a sensitivity analysis to highlight the most critical factors.
    \item[$\bullet$]Adapt the model to other overtourism-affected destinations, considering how location choice impacts the importance of different measures. Explore ways to use the model to promote less-visited attractions or locations to achieve a balanced tourism distribution.
    \item[$\bullet$]Draft a one-page memo to the Juneau Tourist Council, outlining predictions, the effects of various measures, and recommendations for optimizing outcomes.
 \end{itemize}

 \section{A causal model of the impact of tourist numbers on satisfaction}
 \subsection{Construction of causal model}
 In Juneau, the impacts of tourist count can be simplified into the following model. In order to better quantify the impact of various factors on the locals and tourists, we set tourist satisfaction and local satisfaction as measuring standards.
 
 \begin{figure}[htbp]  %h此处，t页顶，b页底，p独立一页，浮动体出现的位置 [H]

     \setlength{\itemsep}{1ex} %条目间距
 \item [\textbf{Explanations:}] 
        \item Tourist count: The number of tourists. When the number up to a limited point, it will reduce the satisfaction of tourists since its overcrowded experience.
        \item Infrastructures and Environment: The state of infrastructures and the living condition. Overtourism may lead to a considerable deterioration on infrastructures in Juneau and damage on the environment.
        \item Expenditure: The expenditure of tourists, which can be divided into incomes of the locals and taxes. Part of the tax can be used to maintain infrastructures.
        \item AHR: Anthropogenic heat release.
        \item "+": Positive correlation.
        \item "-": Negative correlation.\\
 \end{itemize}
 \subsection{Model Analysis}
 The model is established with reference to literature related to Juneau and objectively analyzes the impacts of different factors. In Figure 2, positive and negative signs are used to indicate the positive and negative correlations between factors. Surveys in Juneau show that an excessive number of tourists can, on the one hand, increase the income of local residents, and on the other hand, put pressure on infrastructure and the environment. However, the increase in the number of tourists can also bring considerable tax revenue to the government, which can be used to maintain infrastructure and carry out environmental construction. On the other hand, through the calculation method of THF (tourism heat footprint), we can calculate the average AHR (Anthropogenic heat release) of tourists, and then predict the glacier melting through AHR. Glacier melting may also lead to a decrease in tourist satisfaction, and the destruction of the environment and infrastructure will simultaneously reduce the satisfaction of both local residents and tourists. Therefore, by using a multi-objective optimization model with the number of tourists as the independent variable, we can obtain the Pareto optimal solution set, and the tourist count within the solution set is relatively ideal and can develop sustainable tourism.
 \subsection{Establishment of mathematical models}
 \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \setlength{\parsep}{0ex} %段落间距
\setlength{\topsep}{2ex} %列表到上下文的垂直距离
\setlength{\itemsep}{1ex} %条目间距
\item 税跟游客数量的数学模型\\
旅游税的增加在一定程度上会影响游客的数量。从文献\cite{taxandtour}中我们可以得出旅游税每增加 10\%旅游人数就减少 5.4\%的结论。利用该结论并结合文献\cite{pop}中的数据，我们可以建立数学模型：\\
$$C=1670000 \times 0.946^{10x-48}$$\\
其中C为游客数量，x为税率。从途径上，增加旅游税可以在一定程度上限制游客的人数，在控制游客数量的时候可以考虑增加税款，但是由于模型相对简陋，对于过高或者过低的税率的情形没有作出很好的预测，所以在这里限制旅游税率的范围：$$3\% \leq x  \leq 20\%$$
这里我们可以得到一个可观的曲线图：

    \caption{Relationship between Tourist Count and Tax Rate} % 图片标题                 
    \label{fig1}%交互引用
    \end{figure}
\item 游客满意度的数学模型\\
通过前面建立的因果模型，我们定义游客满意度分为CIS和CTS。对于CIS，我们定义：
$$CIS=F(IS)$$
$$IS=CDI+TTI$$
其中的函数F时将State of infrastructures转化为CIS的函数，后面会进行解释。通过查阅政府报告\cite{Inf},我们得到government\textquotesingle s EIE和CDI。
对数据进行拟合，我们得到CDI的数学模型：
$$
CDI=
\begin{cases}
    -12C^{1.05}, &if\ C\ is\ no\ more\ than\ 15000\\
    -12C^{1.06}, &if\ C\ is\ more\ than\ 15000
\end{cases}
$$
CDI的图线如下：
对于税款我们可以通过报告\cite{spend}中得到的E和x求出：
$$T=C\cdot E\cdot x$$
根据报告中的数据以及往年对于基础设施上的支出，我们最终拟合出了TTI的函数。
$$TTI=
\begin{cases}
    T-150000, &if\ T\ is\ no\ more\ than\ 546000\\
    \frac{25T}{1.2 \log_{1.4}{100x}}, &if\ T\ is\ more\ than\ 546000
\end{cases}
$$
图线如下：

    \end{figure}
模型展示了税收变多到了一定程度时，在基建上的投入比例会有所降低。
如此，我们可以获得IS的图线：
\begin{figure}[H]  %h此处，t页顶，b页底，p独立一页，浮动体出现的位置 [H]
 
    \centering  %图表居中
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{IS.png} %图片的名称或者路径之中有空格会出问题 
    \caption{Graph of IS} % 图片标题                 
    \label{fig1}%交互引用
    \end{figure}
F 是将IS转化为satisfaction的函数，对于本地人和游客而言都是相同的。我们定义satisfaction为一种评判的指标，其值域范围为-100到100。
$$
CIS(LIS)=
\begin{cases}
    IS\times 2.408\times 10^{-5}-100, &if\ IS\ is\ no\ more\ than\ 4200000\\
    \log_{1.01}{\frac{x-10}{40000}}-470, &11624010\geq IS \geq 4200000
\end{cases}
$$
Finally, we get a function:
$$CS=U(CIS,CTS)$$
\item 本地人满意度的数学模型
同样的，我们可以将本地人的满意度(LS)分为LinS和LIS。\\
对于Inc，我们得到下列的数学模型：
$$Inc=C\cdot E\cdot (1-x)\times \frac{365}{10000}$$
其中乘上365是计算年收入，由于已知朱诺本地有30000居民，假设每一户人家都有三个人，便可得到Inc。根据资料\cite{Hap}对于收入和幸福的数据，我们拟合出了曲线：
$$LinS=
\begin{cases}
    (\log_{5}{\frac{\frac{Inc}{12}+6500}{480000}}+2.25)\times \frac{100}{0.4}\\
    (\log_{10}{\frac{Inc+400000}{480000}}+0.152)\times \frac{100}{0.4}
\end{cases}
$$
As for the LIS, 这个和CIS的公式是相同的，此处不再赘述。最终我们得到了这样一个函数:
$$LS=U(LinS,LIS)$$
\item 冰川消融模型\\
从文献\cite{glac}中可以得到冰川消融速度的计算方法：
$$THF=\frac{wTHF}{C}$$
$$GM=\alpha \cdot THF$$
这里我们代入数据得到了预估冰川消融量为$2.34\times 10^{-7} m/a/person$.
\end{enumerate}
 \section{Multi-Objective Optimization Model}
 \subsection{The Analytic Hierarchy Process}
 The Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) is a kind of method which combines qualitative and quantitative methods to calculate the decision weight of complex multi-objective problem. To figure out a comprehensive solution, we use AHP to estimate LS and CS.
 \begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
    c1 & 0.98 \\
    c2 & 0.02 \\
    l1 & 0.5  \\
    l2 & 0.5 \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
    \end{table}
    Then we can get LS and CS:\\
$$CS=c1\cdot CIS+c2\cdot CTS$$
$$LS=l1\cdot LinS+l2\cdot LIS$$
Now we can get exact numbers of CS and LS, to make further optimization, we will use NSGA-II algorithm to get a Pareto solution.
 \subsection{NSGA-II }
 
 
 

 \section{Sensitivity Analysis}
 \subsection{CDI changes}
 
 
 \begin{figure}[H]  %h此处，t页顶，b页底，p独立一页，浮动体出现的位置 [H]
 
 \centering  %图表居中
 \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{sensitivity12.png} %图片的名称或者路径之中有空格会出问题

 \label{figy}%交互引用
 \end{figure}

 As shown in the figure, when CDI decreases from $12 to $8, the optimal tourist count does not change and remains around 15000,
 Therefore, it can be considered that the optimal tourist count is relatively insensitive to CDI and has strong robustness. 
 \subsection{Increase in tax rate}
  %我们把船票价格提升20\%，额外的收入用于维护旅游环境；结果显示，可持续旅游人数限制上升至15620人，表明额外的船税对维护可持续旅游有轻微积极影响；
    %我们提升了3\%的综合税率，结果显示，可持续旅游人数限制上升至16060人，表明额外的综合税率对维护可持续旅游有中度影响；但是，由于维护环境，特别是保护冰川的边际效益较小，更高的税率对提升可持续旅游人数限制不产生显著作用，反而可能减少游客的旅游意愿。
    We increased the ferry ticket price by 20\%, and allocated the additional revenue to the maintenance of the tourism environment; the results showed that the sustainable limit for the number of tourists increased to 15,620, indicating that the additional ferry tax has a slight positive effect on maintaining sustainable tourism.
    
    We raised the comprehensive tax rate by 3\%, and the results indicated that the sustainable limit for the number of tourists increased to 16,060, suggesting that the additional comprehensive tax rate has a moderate impact on maintaining sustainable tourism. However, due to the diminishing marginal benefits of environmental conservation, especially the protection of glaciers, higher tax rates do not significantly enhance the sustainable limit for the number of tourists and may instead reduce tourists' willingness to travel.
    \subsection{The reduction of environmental protection costs}
    Investing in environmental protection publicity advertisements may be beneficial for preserving the tourism environment. Based on the information provided, we assume that the government allocates a portion of its funds for publicity purposes, thereby reducing the costs needed to maintain the environment for each tourist. The results indicate that with just a 4\% increase in the ferry tax, the sustainable limit for the number of tourists rises to 16,620, showing that investing in environmental protection publicity advertisements has a significantly positive effect compared to direct investment in environmental protection, especially under moderate-scale promotion. Therefore, we recommend that the government invest in advertising campaigns to encourage tourists to protect the environment.

 \section{A Memo to the tourist council of Juneau}
 \noindent
 \textbf{Date:} January 27th, 2025

 \noindent
 \textbf{To:} Tourist Council of Juneau

 \noindent
 \textbf{From:} MCM Team \#2511654

 \noindent
 \textbf{Subject: A Multi-Objective Optimization Model for Adjusting Tourist Count}
 {\noindent}	 \rule[-0pt]{16.5cm}{0.15em}\\
\noindent
\textbf{Dear members of the council:}

As tourism flourishes in Juneau, we recognize that over-tourism may bring challenges to our city. To promote economic development while protecting our natural environment and residents' quality of life, our team has conducted in-depth research and developed a comprehensive and reliable model, yielding practical predictions and recommendations.

\noindent
\textbf{Our Model and Advantages}

\textbf{1. Comprehensive Causal Model:} We have created a comprehensive causal model that analyzes the impact of tourist numbers on residents' income, government revenue, infrastructure conditions, and the ecological environment. Based on reliable data, we have conducted mathematical modeling to provide a holistic understanding of the interplay between tourism and various aspects of our city.

\textbf{2. Reliable Multi-Objective Optimization Model:} We have established reliable functions for tourist and resident satisfaction and used genetic algorithms to obtain the Pareto solution for tourist numbers, maximizing the satisfaction of all stakeholders.

\noindent
\textbf{Our Predictions}

After solving the multi-objective optimization model, we recommend maintaining the current tourist numbers at around 14,550 to promote sustainable tourism.

\noindent
\textbf{Our Recommendations}

\textbf{1. Gradual Tax Increase: }A gradual increase in taxes (ranging from 3\% to 20\%) will help raise the tourist limit necessary for sustainable tourism development.

\textbf{2. Environmental Protection Campaign: }Allocating a portion of the funds to launch environmental protection campaigns and encouraging tourists to protect the environment can reduce the economic costs associated with environmental protection.

We believe implementing these measures will balance tourism development and environmental protection, ensuring a sustainable future for Juneau.

\noindent Sincerely,

\noindent Team \#2511654
